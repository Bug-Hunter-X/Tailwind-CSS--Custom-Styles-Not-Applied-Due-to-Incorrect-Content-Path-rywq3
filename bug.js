```javascript
// ... your Tailwind CSS configuration ...

module.exports = {
  // ... other configurations ...
  content: ['./src/**/*.{html,js,jsx,ts,tsx}'], // Or wherever your templates are
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'custom-color': '#abcdef',
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

This configuration looks correct at first glance, but let's say you have a file named `myComponent.jsx` which uses `custom-color`:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div className="bg-custom-color">
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  );
}

```

And the `myComponent.jsx` file is not correctly being picked up by the TailwindCSS `content` option because it's located in a subdirectory that isn't explicitly included.  Tailwind won't recognize the `bg-custom-color` class and it may show up as a plain `div` in your application without styling.
