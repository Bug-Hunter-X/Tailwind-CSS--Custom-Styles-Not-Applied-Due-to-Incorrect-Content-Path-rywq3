```javascript
// ... your Tailwind CSS configuration ...

module.exports = {
  // ... other configurations ...
  content: ['./src/**/*.{html,js,jsx,ts,tsx}','./src/**/components/**/*.{html,js,jsx,ts,tsx}'], // More inclusive content path
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'custom-color': '#abcdef',
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

This corrected `content` option now explicitly includes the components directory. Any other directory or file which includes a custom color from `theme` must also be added.  If you have multiple subdirectories, it's best to make your content path as inclusive as possible. You may need to recursively search through your folders with the use of `**`.
